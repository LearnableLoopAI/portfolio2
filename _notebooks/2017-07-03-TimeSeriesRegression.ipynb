    "Consider how easy it is for the human visual system to handle this problem, and in a fraction of a second. In fact, this is exactly how analysts sometimes do their change detections manually. This suggests that we might benefit from tapping into the biological mechanisms for analyzing visual data (i.e. images). Recently, some researchers started adopting this insight. See, for example, Wang and Oates (2015a, 2015b, 2015c) and Wang, Zan and Oates (2017). The essence of this line of thought is the following: Instead of analyzing a sequence of 1-D or scalar-valued *temporal* data points, we transform them into a single 2-D or matrix-valued *spatial* data point. The spatial data point is simply an image which means the time-series signal has been transformed into an image. This allows for the application of a large body of relatively well-developed computer vision techniques to the above-stated problem. Most of these techniques center around the *Convolutional Neural Network* (CNN). In summary, the *time-series regression* problem has been converted to an *image regression* problem."

In our case, transfer learning was based on the ImageNet model which was trained on over 14 million images to classify them into more than 20,000 categories. There are many cloud providers offering the use of GPUs (Graphical Processing Units), ideal for the training process. GPUs are not necessary for inference. Even without access to a GPU, the training process is still tractable on an ordinary laptop. This is the beauty of transfer learning."
