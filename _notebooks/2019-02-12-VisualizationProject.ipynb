Understandably, this value varies widely due to a translator’s quality of work, level of dedication, brilliance, etc. Even so, my story will reveal that there is a gradual decline of mean time required per sentence as the BLEU score increases.

It is fair to assign a zero score for such documents because the BLEU algorithm would not find any similarities between the original English document and the final translated document. In other words, the BLEU algorithm would have come up with a value of zero or a value close to zero."
