    "The gradual adoption of *Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast* (ADS–B) by airlines is leading to the wide availability of flight data in the public domain. Wikipedia gives a good overview of this technology (\"Automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast,\" n.d.). The ADS-B technology allows an aircraft to use satellite navigation to find its position. It then broadcasts this information periodically which enables ground stations to track it. This method is used as a replacement for secondary surveillance radar (SSR) and does not depend on an interrogation signal from the ground. The data that is broadcast can also update the situational awareness of other aircraft in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing use of ADS-B has led to many flight tracking sites that publish basic flight data for consumption by the public. See \"This Is How Flight Tracking Sites Work\" (Rabinowitz, 2017). This data is relatively superficial and usually consists of a dozen or so measured quantities. Some of the more prominent players are:\n",
