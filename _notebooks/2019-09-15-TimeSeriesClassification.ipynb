    "This project suggests an automatic way for post-flight analysts to undertake classification of flight profiles into useful versus non-useful classes. Instead of using the traditional algorithms for time-series classification, this work makes use of a relatively new approach: Before classifying, first transform a time-series into an image. This allows for the application of a well-developed set of algorithms from the area of computer vision. In this project, we perform a comparison of a number of these transformation techniques in terms of their associated image classification performance. We apply each transformation technique to the time-series dataset in turn, train a Convolutional Neural Network to do classification, and record the performance. Then we select the most performant transformation technique (a simple line plot that got a 100% F1-score) and use it in the rest of the analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of three models. The first model classifies flight profiles into developed (useful) and non-developed (non-useful) profiles. The second model performs multi-label classification on the developed profiles from the first model. The labels reflect whether a profile has canonical climb/cruise/descent segments. The last model classifies flight profiles with canonical cruise segments into classes that have extended cruises (useful) and shorter cruises (non-useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we prepare a significant unlabeled test dataset, consisting of data points that have never been seen by any of the models. We construct an end-to-end analytic inference process to simulate a production system, apply it to the test dataset, and obtain impressive results. Finally, we make recommendations to post-flight and other interested analysts.\n",

    "One of the important operational characteristics of a commercial airliner is its flight path. This term needs qualification though. The *lateral* flight path is the track projected onto a flat earth from above. To visualize the lateral flight path one can plot longitude versus latitude as flight time progresses. The *vertical* flight path, on the other hand, is the altitude profile (viewed from the side). This may be visualized by plotting altitude versus flight time. This project will focus on the vertical flight path. When we use the term flight path or flight profile in the rest of the document, we will always refer to the *vertical* flight path."

    "During normal operation, an airliner has a predictable flight path. After *takeoff*, it climbs as quickly as possible (during the phase known as *climb*) until it reaches a point called the *top of climb*. The pilot then levels off and usually maintains this altitude for most of the flight (straight-and-level flight). This phase of the flight is known as *cruise*. When nearing its destination, a point is reached that is known as *top of descent*. At this point the pilot enters the *descent* phase. Finally, the flight ends during the *landing* of the aircraft."

    "Post-flight data analysts are often interested in separating useful from non-useful (or less useful) flight paths prior to a specific analysis. In this document, and its associated analysis code, useful profiles will be labeled as *typical* (abbreviated as “typ”) while less useful, non-useful, or anomalous flight paths (for a specific analysis) will be labeled as *non-typical* (abbreviated as “non”). A *typical* flight profile, in the context of this document, has a relatively extended cruise section without changes in altitude (see Figure 1.1). This characteristic will make it useful for certain types of analyses, for example, to estimate hard-to-measure variables like drag and exact angle-of-attack, as well as estimations of the positions of vertical flight control surfaces (even though they are measured). Flight paths could also be considered *non-typical* due to insignificant (i.e. too short) cruise segments and missing data (see Figure 1.2). Note that our definition of usefulness is by no means universal in post-flight analysis."

    "Consider how easy it is for the human visual system to handle this problem, and in a fraction of a second. In fact, this is exactly how analysts often do their classifications manually. This suggests that we might benefit from tapping into the biological mechanisms for analyzing visual data (i.e. images). Recently, some researchers started adopting this insight. See, for example, Wang and Oates (2015a). The essence of this line of thought is the following: Instead of analyzing a sequence of 1-D or scalar-valued *temporal* data points, we transform them into a single 2-D or matrix-valued *spatial* data point. The spatial data point is simply an image which means the time-series signal has been transformed into an image (see Figure 1.3 for an example of a transformation technique). This allows for the application of a large body of relatively well-developed computer vision techniques to the above-stated problem. Most of these techniques center around the *Convolutional Neural Network* (CNN). In summary, the *time-series classification* problem has been converted to an *image classification* problem."

    "In a situation of significant class imbalance, it is natural to use an anomaly detection algorithm. In the area of deep learning a method that is often used is the *autoencoder*. An autoencoder neural network is an unsupervised learning algorithm in which the target values are set to be equal to the inputs. This means that $\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}=\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$. The neural network consequently learns to reproduce its own input. This arrangement can be exploited by training it only on *normal* examples. When, after training, an *anomalous* example is submitted, the mean square error (MSE), also called the *reconstruction error*, is detectably higher. This higher MSE can then be used to flag anomalous datapoints. The Stanford article “[Autoencoders](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/)” provides a thorough introduction."

They are all developed and have canonical and extended cruise segments, as we set out to find. There were 290 non-useful, or less useful, profiles in the final stage. It is immediately obvious how much time might be saved by using the analytics pipeline rather than having to inspect all 582 raw profiles manually to arrive at the 26 useful ones. There will be, no doubt, some miss-classifications too. This is unavoidable as the error rate of each stage contributes towards the pipeline’s overall error rate."

    "We have demonstrated how flight profile time-series can be turned into images for more effective classification. Then we identified the best technique to transform a profile time-series into an image for use by the classification process. Using transfer learning, we showed how quickly a deep learning model could be trained. We conclude that the need for hand classification of flight profiles has been reduced greatly leading to significant time savings potential for post-flight analysts. Making use of a publicly available rich flight data set we hope this work will encourage ordinary data scientists (which do not have access to company flight data) as well as post-flight analysts (that do have access) to undertake studies in this important area."

Here we used the fastai Python library (built on top of PyTorch) and the Python language. There are a number of other useful technology environments, e.g. Java, TensorFlow, Julia, and MATLAB."

    "We suggest that analysts need not shy away from the use of deep learning for post-flight analysis. The use of transfer learning makes the training of deep learning models very tractable. In our case, transfer learning was based on the ImageNet model which was trained on over 14 million images to classify them into more than 20,000 categories. There are many cloud providers offering the use of GPUs (Graphical Processing Units), ideal for the training process. GPUs are not necessary for inference. Even without access to a GPU, the training process is still tractable on an ordinary laptop. This is the beauty of transfer learning."

    "In this work, we:\n",
    "* Performed a comparison of a number of transformation techniques in terms of their associated image classification performance. We applied each transformation technique to the cleaned time-series dataset in turn, trained a CNN to do classification (using supervised learning), and recorded the performance. Then we selected the most performant transformation technique and used it in the rest of the analysis pipeline. The following transformation techniques were considered:\n",
    "    * Altitude line plots transformed into an image\n",
    "    * Altitude area plots transformed into an image\n",
    "    * Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF)\n",
    "    * Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF)\n",
    "    * Markov Transition Field (MTF)\n",
    "    * Recurrence Plot (RP)\n",
    "* Trained a model to classify flight profiles into developed (useful) and non-developed (non-useful) profiles. We also considered the use of anomaly detection by means of an autoencoder (instead of a classification algorithm) due to the significant class imbalance and concluded that the autoencoder did not work as well as the classifier.\n",
    "* Trained a model to do multi-label classification of developed profiles. The labels reflected whether a profile had a canonical climb/cruise/descent segment.\n",
    "* Trained a model to classify flight profiles with canonical cruise segments (regardless of the properties of climb or descent segments) into profiles that have extended cruises (useful) and shorter cruises (non-useful).\n",
    "* Prepared a significant test dataset, consisting of datapoints that have never been seen by any of the models and have not been labeled. We constructed an end-to-end analytic inference process to simulate a production system and applied it to the test dataset. Finally, we made recommendations to post-flight and other interested analysts."
