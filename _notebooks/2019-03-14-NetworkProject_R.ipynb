The symbolic vertex names (airport codes) are not shown to improve clarity. There are 755 vertices and 23,473 edges (although this is not apparent from the visualization).

Another characteristic of this network is its apparent partitioning of vertices into a number of cohesive subgroups. There seems to be two main subgroups and several smaller ones.

It cleanly partitions the vertices into three communities. One community is strongly centered around Atlanta, GA. It has a particularly central and strong hub (Atlanta) from where a number of “spokes” emanates to smaller airports. This is not a surprise. Most Americans know that Atlanta is a world-wide flight hub. Due to its star-like structure, we expect the density of the subgraph associated with this “Atlanta” community to be low.

The fact that the Hawaii cluster is so prominent reflects the substantial holiday traffic associated with this tropical island during the mainland’s winter season.
